Upcoming updates to Project Nimbus:
Adding the ability for the bot to drop the kit you requested if you did not accept the tpa in time. This will also reduce players getting more then 1 kit at a time
Adding ~leave. This allows project-nimbus staff to force the bot out of the server just in case of a critical error
Adding ~server to Archive Bot. This allows users in the discord to know what server the bot in currently being used on
(Planning) ~dupe. This allows the player to give the bot 4 shulker boxes and dupe up to 16 of them
Most to all features should be added in Project Nimbus v1.7
