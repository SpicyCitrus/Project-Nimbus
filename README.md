### What you can personally request
- The Project Nimbus Team values your right to privacy. If you wish to request the following you may create a support ticket in the discord.
> - You may request that your username is completly removed from all databases/logs of the bot (this includes all records so you will no longer be shown on our pie chart)
> - You may request to not be filmed during interviews/meetings regarding Project Nimbus
### How often does project nimbus get updates?
> pretty often i would say
### I did ~rekit and its not giving me a kit
- Here are some reasons why our bot may not being providing your kit
> 1. You may have been blacklisted (contact support for more info on blacklistings)
> 2. You may have a prefix on your client. Make sure ~rekit is the first and only word you type when requesting a kit
> 3. You dont have ~ on your keyboard. Sadly not all keyboards come with the ~ key so you will notice we have provided the command "~rekit" in alot of the github page. So you can copy the command (crl+c crl+v) and still use our service 
### How to identify a fake project-nimbus staff member
- People may claim to be project-nimbus staff so heres how to tell if they are fake or not
> 1. All project-nimbus staff are "Helper" role in the discord server
> 2. True project-nimbus staff will never threten you about your coords
> 3. Project-nimbus does not log/send coords to any staff or owners so if someone claims to have gotten coords from project-nimbus they are lying
> 4. more coming soon
