SpicyCitrus was messaged via discord that a group of players have teamed up and wanted to show off their work.

this group single handedly put the entire server of 0b0t.org in a kit queue of 144 requests

this group contained the players 

The_Gryfek
OMyst1c_
GodOfAllWaffles
xdarked
Osunlighlt
_CrunchyRoll_
if you helped with this idea please dm spicy

if theres any custom messages you want me to add please dm localhost
